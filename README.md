# 🔢 Java Swing Calculator

A simple yet powerful **GUI-based calculator** built using **Java Swing**. This project demonstrates the implementation of **JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel**, and event-driven programming to create an interactive calculator. 

## 🚀 Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**.
- Responsive GUI with **Nimbus Look and Feel**.
- Modular design with multiple **.java and .form** files:
  - `Calculadora.java` - Main class handling logic and event actions.
  - `Calculadora.form` - Swing UI layout for the main frame.
  - `NewJPanel.java` & `NewJPanel.form` - Additional panels for GUI structure.

## 📌 Technical Overview
This project follows an **MVC-like approach**, where the logic is handled in event listeners while the UI is managed with Java Swing components. The operations are processed in a `switch` statement inside the `jButton14ActionPerformed` method, ensuring efficient execution.

### 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java SE**
- **Swing Framework**
- **Event Listeners**
- **Nimbus Look and Feel**

## 🏗 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in **NetBeans** or any Java-supported IDE.
3. Compile and run `Calculadora.java`.

## 🤖 Future Improvements
- Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR).
- Enhance UI with modern Swing components like **JTable**.
- Add exception handling for division by zero.
